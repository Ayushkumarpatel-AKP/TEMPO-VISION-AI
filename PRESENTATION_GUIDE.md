**Answer:** 
"NASA's TEMPO satellite provides:
1. Hourly updates (traditional satellites: once/day)
2. High resolution: 10km² grid
3. Tropospheric focus: Where we breathe
4. Multiple pollutants: NO2, aerosols, etc.
5. Professional-grade accuracy: Research quality data"

### **Q6: "What makes this better than existing AQI apps?"**
**Answer:** 
"Three key differentiators:
1. **Predictive**: We show tomorrow's AQI, not just today
2. **Comprehensive**: Weather + Satellites + Ground sensors
3. **Visual**: Interactive maps, charts, satellite imagery
4. **Free**: No subscription needed
5. **Global**: Not limited to one country/region"
